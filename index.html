                    <p>Dear Patients,</p>

                    <p>You may have heard that dental practices are able to open again from Monday 8 June.</p>

                    <p>Stokesley Dental Practice will again be open from this date, however unfortunately it will not be
                        business as usual. The treatments you are offered may be different to those you received before,
                        depending on staff and equipment available. It will take some time before services return to
                        what you previously experienced as normal. Please be patient.</p>

                    <p>Infection control has always been a top priority for our practice and you may have seen this
                        during your visits to our surgery. Our infection control processes are made so that when you
                        receive care, it&rsquo;s both safe and comfortable. We want to tell you about the infection
                        control procedures we follow in our practice to keep patients and staff safe.</p>

                    <p>You may see some changes when it is time for your next appointment. We made these changes to help
                        protect our patients and staff. For example: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li> Our practice will communicate with you beforehand to ask some screening questions. You’ll
                            be asked those same questions again at your appointment
                        </li>
                        <li> We have hand sanitiser that we will ask you to use when you enter the practice. You will
                            also find some in the reception area and other places in the practice for you to use as
                            needed.
                        </li>
                        <li> We no longer offer magazines, children’s toys and so forth, since those items are difficult
                            to clean and disinfect
                        </li>
                        <li> Appointments will be managed to allow for social distancing between patients. That might
                            mean that you’re offered fewer options for scheduling your appointment.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p> We will be allowing greater time between patients to reduce waiting times for you, as well as to
                        reduce the number of patients in the reception area at any one time. How you can help: </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>With the exception of children and patients with carers, patients should come alone</li>
                        <li>A distance of at least 2 metres must be observed if another patient is present in the dental
                            practice
                        </li>
                        <li>Payment should be made by card over the phone where possible</li>
                        <li>Staff will not shake your hand</li>
                        <li> If you show symptoms following appointment booking, you should contact the practice by
                            phone.
                        </li>
                        <li> Please do not arrive without an appointment</li>
                        <li>Patients should come wearing a mask or facial covering if possible.</li>
                        <li>There will be no toilet facilities available.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-center text-2xl">Thank You</p>
